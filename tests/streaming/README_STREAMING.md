# Agno API Streaming Support

This document provides an overview of the streaming support implemented for the Agno API.

## Overview

Streaming allows clients to receive responses from the API as they are generated, rather than waiting for the entire response to be completed. This provides a better user experience for applications that display AI-generated content to users.

## Implementation Details

The streaming support has been implemented in the following components:

1. **API Endpoints (`app/api/endpoints.py`)**:
   - Updated to handle streaming requests via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Added proper JSON serialization for streaming chunks

2. **OpenAI Service (`app/core/openai_service.py`)**:
   - Modified to handle streaming responses from Agno
   - Implemented proper chunk handling and error management

3. **Models (`app/models/chat.py`)**:
   - Added `StreamingChunk` model for representing stream chunks
   - Extended the `ChatRequest` model to include a `stream` flag

## How to Test

We provide two test scripts for demonstrating streaming functionality:

### Basic Streaming Test

Run the following command to test basic streaming functionality:

```bash
python tests/streaming/test_streaming.py
```

You can also specify a different model using the `--model` flag:

```bash
python tests/streaming/test_streaming.py --model "gpt-4"
```

### Visual Streaming Test

For a more visual demonstration of streaming (with added delay between characters), use:

```bash
python tests/streaming/stream_test_with_delay.py
```

This script adds a small delay between displaying characters, which helps visualize the streaming behavior.

## Current Limitations

- The current implementation returns chunks that may not always form coherent text segments. This may be related to how Agno's streaming implementation works with the specific models.
- Empty chunks may be received and should be filtered out by client applications.

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements for the streaming implementation include:

1. Better handling of token chunking to ensure more coherent text segments
2. More extensive error handling and recovery
3. Performance optimizations for high-volume streaming
4. Client-side improvements for graceful handling of variable chunk sizes
